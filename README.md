# Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, AWS(DevOps) Portfolio 🚀

This repository contains multiple projects demonstrating expertise in cloud-native application development and DevOps practices. The projects utilize tools such as AWS Lambda, AWS SDK, Docker, Kubernetes (Minikube & EKS), Spring Boot, and Terraform.

---

## 📁 Project Structure

### 📦 `AWSLambda`
- AWS Lambda function written in **Java**
- Demonstrates serverless function deployment
- Useful for lightweight backend logic and event-driven use cases

### 📦 `AWSSDK`
- Spring Boot integration with **AWS SDK for Java**
- Calls AWS services like Lambda or S3 from within a Spring Boot app

### 📦 `Minikube-kubernetes`
- Microservice deployments on **Minikube**
- Kubernetes manifests for services, deployments, and ingress
- Ideal for local development and testing Kubernetes clusters

### 📦 `SpringBoot-Docker-ECR-EKS`
- Spring Boot containerized with **Docker**
- Pushed to **AWS ECR** and deployed to **AWS EKS**
- Uses `eksctl`, `kubectl` for deployment

### 📦 `Terraform`
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using **Terraform**
- Automates setup of AWS resources (Ex-EC2)
- Reusable modules for production-ready infrastructure

### 📦 `product-aws-cicd`
 - CI/CD pipeline for `product` using:
 - Code Build
 - Code Pipeline
 - Docker & AWS ECR
 - AWS EKS for deployment
 - Pipeline automates build → test → package → deploy
